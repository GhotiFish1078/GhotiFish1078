- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GhotiFish1078
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning front-end and back-end technologies, and enjoy playing Team Fortress 2 in my spare time. My main is the Demoman. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS so I can design good looking, albeit static webpages, with future plans to learn Javascript to give these webpages that added *interactivity*
- ğŸ“« You can reach me through my email: helloitsmeimegone@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I squirted paint into my eyes ones because the paint had dried and so I looked directly into the nozzle drying to figure out what happened
